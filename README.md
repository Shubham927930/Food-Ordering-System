Restaurants need efficient systems to handle food orders without relying on manual methods, which can be slow and prone to errors. 
The system is designed to mimic the core functionalities of a real -world food ordering platform, including user account management, a dynamic menu, discount application and order history. 
This project aims to create a Food Ordering System using Java. Users can register, log in, browse a menu, and place order via the command line. 
The system also allows admins to manage the menu, offerings features such as adding or removing items.
